# Python

In this Achievement, I was tasked with exploratory and prescriptive analysis for grocery delivery & pickup service Instacart. 

In the process, I performed operations such as:
  * data wrangling and consistency checks
  * subsetting
  * combining datasets
  * deriving & aggregating new variables
  * created a deliverable for hypothetical stakeholders

Folders are organized by file type.

"Preliminary Files" are answers to assignment questions that lead up to the final project.
"Final Project" contains my data dictionary and an Excel document communicating my findings to a technical colleague.
