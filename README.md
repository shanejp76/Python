# Python

In this Achievement, I was tasked with exploratory and prescriptive analysis for grocery delivery & pickup service Instacart. 

In the process, I performed operations such as:
  * data wrangling and consistency checks
  * subsetting
  * combining datasets
  * deriving & aggregating new variables
  * created a deliverable for hypothetical stakeholders

Case Study on this project [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r44tBRuZ_537g2PGmOEBfqcfqtKdlnqj/view?usp=sharing).


Folders are organized by file type.
 >* "Instacart - Tableau.zip" is visuals extracted from the Instacart deliverable
 >* "Instacart - Python Visuals.zip" is visuals created during project. I can create Python charts, but I prefer the cleaner style of Tableau.
