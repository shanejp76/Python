# Python

For this project, I was tasked with exploratory and prescriptive analysis for grocery delivery & pickup service Instacart. 

In the process, I performed operations such as:
  * data wrangling and consistency checks
  * subsetting
  * combining datasets
  * deriving & aggregating new variables
  * creating a deliverable for stakeholders

File details:
 >* "Instacart - Tableau.zip" is visuals extracted from the Instacart deliverable.
 >* "Instacart - Python Visuals.zip" is visuals created during project. Python charts are fine, but I prefer the cleaner style of Tableau.
 >* "Instacart - Final Report.xlsx.zip" documents changes & findings for hypothetical Instacart stakeholders.
 >* Files with prefix "Jupyter - " are from Jupyter Notebooks.
